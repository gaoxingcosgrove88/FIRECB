name: 'PGxCWL: Creating reproducible pharmacogenomic analysis pipelines'
description: The field of pharmacogenomics presents great challenges for researchers
  that are willing to make their studies reproducible and shareable. This is attributed
  to the generation of large volumes of high-throughput multimodal data, and the lack
  of standardized workflows that are robust, scalable, and flexible to perform large-scale
  analyses. To address this issue, we developed pharmacogenomic workflows in the Common
  Workflow Language to process two breast cancer datasets in a reproducible and transparent
  manner. Our pipelines combine both pharmacological and molecular profiles into a
  portable data object that can be used for future analyses in cancer research. Our
  data objects and workflows are shared on Harvard Dataverse and Code Ocean where
  they have been assigned a unique Digital Object Identifier, providing a level of
  data provenance and a persistent location to access and share our data with the
  community.
